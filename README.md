# Project-2-trading-platform
My Stock Pal

- A project by Cryptofy

## Description
Our application seeks to simplify and personalize the trading experience for someone who is a novice in stock market trading. Users sign up to a trading account where they are shown the latest up to data market news, sourced from Morningstar, as well the stock prices and financial data for a searched stock, sourced from Yahoo Finance. They are redirected to a user summary page where they can trade, invest, sell stocks and add to / view their watched list. 

## Motivation
For many young or inexperienced traders, entering the trading world can be daunting. Our underlying motivation was to make the process as easy and as seamless as possible, by keeping the application basic! And most importantly, secure. We wanted to display only the most critical financial indicators on the right pane, such as current, low and high price, debt to equity and gross profits, which will help to at least inform some of their decision to invest in a stock.

## User Story
As a user , I want to be able to view my finances, so that I can see the stocks that I own and the stocks I am watching.
I want to be able to add to or remove a stock from my watchlist. 
I also want to be able to sell a stock.

## FUTURE DEVELOPMENT 

Currently, our application is targeted towards US traders as it collects data from the US stock market. Future development will be directed towards collecting instant data from the ASX market (Australian Stock Exchange) as well as ETF’s such as NDQ, and possibly from more International markets down the track.
We will also look to implement real time stock charts that a user can view for each of their stocks and will be synced on a second-by-second basis.  
Also need to add in the Invest feature so a user can invest their stock.
